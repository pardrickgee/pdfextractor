ðŸ§¾ PDF Extractor API (for n8n + Google Drive automation)

A lightweight FastAPI microservice for extracting structured text or tables from consistent PDF templates â€” like Byggefakta / NCC project sheets â€” using pdfplumber.

Itâ€™s designed to be hosted for free on Railway.app
 and easily connected to your n8n workflows (also running on Railway).

ðŸš€ Features

ðŸ§  Extracts text and table sections from specific PDF templates (e.g., PROJEKTER & KONTAKTER).

âš¡ Simple POST /extract endpoint for direct upload or n8n integration.

ðŸ”’ Optional API key authentication.

ðŸ§° No external dependencies like Java or Ghostscript â€” runs fast and cheap.

ðŸª¶ Deployable in under 2 minutes on Railway.

ðŸ§  How it works

You send a PDF file to:

POST /extract


with multipart/form-data containing:

file â†’ the PDF upload

which â†’ "projects,contacts" (optional filter)

Example JSON response:

{
  "ok": true,
  "projects": [
    {"page": 1, "text": "Project 1 ..."}
  ],
  "contacts": [
    {"page": 6, "text": "Contact: John Doe ..."}
  ]
}


You can later replace the simple extractor with a smarter version that parses tables or exports CSVs.
